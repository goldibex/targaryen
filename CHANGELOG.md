## 3.0.0 (2017-01-12)

- [Fix type validation](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/issues/62):
    * Type inferring doesn't throw when it cannot infer a node type; set the type to "any" or "primitive".
    * Type inferring of each side of a binary expression, or of method argument accepts "any" or "primitive" and delay type validation until evaluation.
    * Validate type of string and snapshot method arguments during evaluation.
    * Validate type of each sides of binary expression during evaluation: most arithmetic expressions require numbers, addition also accept operation on string, comparison require string, number or null, equality operations require a primitive or a plain Object.
- [Add live testing for Firebase parity](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/63).
- [Stop evaluating child write rules](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/issues/73).
- [Add more debugging info](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/83).
- [Fix snapshot root parent access](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/97).
- [Fix data node snapshot priority handling](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/96).
- [Refactor API](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/80):
    + Plugins scripts should be imported directly, e.g. `require('targaryen/plugins/chai')`:
        * Add `targaryen/plugins/chai`.
        * Add `targaryen/plugins/jasmine`.
        * Deprecate `targaryen.chai`.
        * Deprecate `targaryen.jasmine`.
        * Deprecate `targaryen.setFirebaseData`.
        * Deprecate `targaryen.setFirebaseRules`.
        * Deprecate `targaryen.setDebug`.
        * Deprecate `targaryen.users`.
    + Simpler API to use targaryen directly:
        * Add `targaryen.database(rules: object|Ruleset, data: object|DataNode, now: null|number): Database`.
        * Add `targaryen.util` functions used by the CLI and the reference plugins for chai and jasmin
        * Remove `targaryen.Ruleset`.
        * Remove `targaryen.DataSnapshot`.
        * Remove `targaryen.helpers`.
- Refactor internal:
    * [Refactor data access and Ruleset](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/72).
    * [Refactor public api](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/80).
    * [Format source based on eslint xo shared configuration](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/81).
    * [Refactor rule parser](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/91).
    * [Simpler tests](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/94).
    * [Move `lib/database`](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/98).
    * [Fix deleting a missing node](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/103).
    * [Add `DataNode.$merge` (`Database.root.$merge`)](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/104).
    * [Better debug info when an operation doesn't trigger any read/write rules](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/107).
    * [Fix regression bug in removing and prune nodes](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/109).
    * [Describe operation in result info (were previously generated by error helpers in `targaryen.utils`)](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/110).
- [Targaryen CLI can parse rules containing multi lines string (would previously only support comments)](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/111).
- [Chai and jasmine plugins include json parser helpers (supporting comments and multi line strings)](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/112)

Thanks goes to @alisson446, @georgesboris, @mhuebert, @RomansBermans and @simenbrekken for their contributions.

- Fix npm description

## 2.3.0 (2016-11-01)

- [Expose Ruleset, DataSnapshot and helpers](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/50).
- [Write operations now replace nodes instead of merging them](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/52).

## 2.2.1 (2016-10-21)

  a node would have been set to null but it's - deleted - children would still have been validated with their old value.
- [Skipping validation of node set to null would skip validation of sibling nodes; this is now fixed](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/48).
- [Treat empty objects as null](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen/pull/51). Thanks to @mhuebert.
